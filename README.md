# Elm + PostgREST Workshop

This workshop's goal is to build a simple search from the API endpoint to the frontend code.

It was based on a personal project called [Haskell Tools](https://github.com/diogob/haskell-tools) and you can check
that repo out for a more complete example.

The keynote presentation and a PDF version are available in the [presentation folder](https://github.com/diogob/elm-workshop/tree/master/presentation).

## Setting up the backend

First make sure you have the proper software to run the backend:

 * [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org)
 * [PostgREST](http://postgrest.com) - to run the REST api server.

## Getting started

The tutorial is divided in x steps:

 1. [Preparing the environment](src/1-environment)
 1. [Fetching and rendering packages](src/2-get-packages)
 1. [Search packages API](src/3-search-packages-api)
 1. [Search packages UI](src/4-search-packages-ui)
 1. Bonus round - [Authentication](src/authentication)
