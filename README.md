# Elm + PostgREST Workshop

This workshop's goal is to build a simple search from the API endpoint to the frontend code.

It was based on a personal project called [Haskell Tools](https://github.com/diogob/haskell-tools) and you can check
that repo out for a more complete example.

## Setting up the backend

First make sure you have the software to run the backend installed:
 * [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org)
 * [PostgREST](http://postgrest.com) - to run the REST api server.
